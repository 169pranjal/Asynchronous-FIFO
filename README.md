# Asynchronous-FIFO
Developed a dual-clock asynchronous FIFO in Verilog, verifying functionality across 100 MHz to 80 MHz clock domains; utilized Gray Code for pointer synchronization to prevent multi-bit transitions and integrated a 2-flip-flop synchronizer to enhance meta-stability resolution in clock domain crossing.
